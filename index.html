        <p>Career is considered a top priority to nearly all people in this world. Depending on your level of mindfulness though, career can be either a great spiritual practice or the cause of great suffering. The difference comes down to your view. The practice of the Buddha’s right view can determine how you think, how you speak and the actions you take within your career. If these things are in balance and come from a place of compassion, then right livelihood is achieved.
            Right livelihood is one of the practices of Buddha’s Noble Eightfold Path. Career is an excellent practical way to determine the type of spiritual energy that you are exuding, and attracting. This is because through the practice, inner abundance manifests itself in outer achievements.
            We have come to believe that our jobs and our livelihood is something outside of ourselves, simply compensation for our time and very separate from a personal spiritual path. However, as we learn to practice meditation and mindfulness, we can begin to apply the teaching of Buddha into every element of our career path and in turn achieve a balance of a healthy spiritual and financial life.

        <h3>SAMVARA</h3>
        <P>Samvara teaches Buddhism for people living in the modern world where a large amount of time is spent working in a job. If you are dissatisfied and drained with your work, or are constantly under the burden of financial stress, it will be very difficult to achieve a spiritual balance in your life. This is why one of Samvara’s primary teachings in the Buddha Dojo is Job Yoga. Job Yoga is the practice of applying selfless and impeccable atten­tion to work in order to achieve spiritual career fulfillment. Peoples actions are a direct result of their intentions and thoughts. If you are practicing pragmatic attention to your work, success in your career can be used as a way to determine your success in your spiritual practice. Samvara and the Buddha Dojo offer specific teachings on the practice of impeccable actions of mindfulness and meditation, and how they can be applied to elevating your career both financially and spiritually.

        <h3>SADHGURU</h3>
        <P>
            When Sadhguru speaks of work he says, “Your work has to be lived, and your life has to be worked at. There is no such thing as work and life, it is life and life.” Everything you do should be to enhance your own nature, because your inner situation will directly affect or hinder the external situation you want to create. 
Sadhguru says that it all comes down to your attention. That your ability to manage your work, is directly proportional to the clarity of your attention and perception of the realities around you. If for example, you focus your attention on being better than others at your job, than your life will be spent trying to be better than others. You will always be looking outside of your own nature. If however, you focus on harnessing fully your own inner energies, then you will find yourself and learn to create your internal situations to greatly enhance your external success.

        <h3>ECKHART TOLLE</h3>
        <P>
            Eckhart Tolle teaches that an important step in finding happiness with your job is first by always being in the present moment, and that by enjoying the present moment you will create an energy shift which opens you to life helping you to align your outer purpose with your inner purpose. 
Tolle states that there are “Three Modalities of Doing.” Acceptance, enjoyment and enthusiasm. At the very least, acceptance of your current position is beneficial, and will get rid of thoughts which tell you that you cannot find joy in a certain job. This in turn can help to create enjoyment within that job. Enthusiasm is an intense energy stream which is part of creativity and helps to align your inner purpose. To work consciously and sanely, you should be in one of these three modalities and if not, you will be in disfunction and should remove yourself from that job or career and try to find your inner purpose.

        <h3>JON KABAT-ZINN</h3>
        <P>Jon Kabat-Zinn is a professor of medicine who studied Zen Buddhism and developed Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), an 8 week course designed to assist people with stress, anxiety and depression. These are problems that can arise from the dissatisfaction in a career where mindfulness isn’t being practiced. Kabat-Zinn teaches that mindfulness is a love affair with life, and not just something you need to squeeze into your schedule. By cultivating moment-to-moment nonjudgmental awareness, you begin to embrace an awareness of the actuality of your experience and accept the good as well as the bad. Through the practice of meditation and mindfulness you can reveal a sense of deeper awareness, turning everything in one’s life into an adventure in living rather than just a chore or something that one has to do.
