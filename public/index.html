            <p>I had struggled monetarily for the majority of my life. Over the years, the financial stress caused me to become bitter and blame external forces for my troubles. I couldn’t sit down and still my mind. When I began seeking and practicing mindfulness and meditation, I realized that work life and spiritual life are one and the same. I could find success in both. A career is an excellent way to gauge the type of spiritual energy that you are exuding, and attracting. Through Buddha’s practice of Right Livelihood, allowing your inner abundance to grow, directly shows itself in outer achievements.

                        Gangaji teaches that much of our suffering comes from our searching and running from being humbled. To search you have to be somebody searching for something. When you search you are always looking outside of yourself for the thing that will bring you peace. When you are “somebody” you fight bad experiences and struggle for good experiences. However when you experience a deeper surrender and allow yourself to become “no-body” then you allow the humbling and stop begging for what you think you lack.

There is no such thing as work and life, it is life and life.” Everything you do should be to enhance your own nature, because your inner situation will directly affect or hinder the external situation you want to create.  If you focus on harnessing your own inner energies, then you will find yourself and learn to create your internal situations to greatly enhance your external success.

Tolle focuses on “Three Modalities of Doing.” Acceptance, enjoyment and enthusiasm. To work consciously and sanely, you should be in at least one of these three modalities and if not, you will be in dysfunction and should remove yourself from that job or career and try to find your inner purpose.

Kabat-Zinn teaches that mindfulness is a love affair with life, and not just something you need to squeeze into your schedule. By cultivating moment-to-moment nonjudgmental awareness, you begin to embrace an awareness of the actuality of your experience and accept the good as well as the bad. Through the practice of meditation and mindfulness you can reveal a sense of deeper awareness, turning everything in one’s life into an adventure in living rather than just a chore or something that one has to do.
