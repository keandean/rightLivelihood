            <p>I had struggled financially for the majority of my life. Financial stress had caused me to become bitter and blame external forces for my troubles. It wasn’t until I started meditating and learning how to be mindful that I realized that my work life and my spiritual life are one and the same and that I could find success in both. Career is an excellent way to gauge the type of spiritual energy that you are exuding, and attracting. This is because through Buddha’s practice of Right Livelihood, allowing your inner abundance to grow, directly shows itself in outer achievements. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Below are seven Buddhist teachers who speak about applying Buddhist practices into the modern world to alleviate stress, learn to be selfless and help you live a fruitful financial and spiritual life.

One of Samvara’s primary teachings in the Buddha Dojo is Job Yoga. Job Yoga is the practice of applying selfless and impeccable atten­tion to work in order to achieve spiritual and career fulfillment. Samvara teaches that if you are practicing pragmatic attention to your work, success in your career can be used as a way to determine your success in your spiritual practice. Samvara and the Buddha Dojo offer specific teachings on the practice of impeccable actions of mindfulness and meditation, and how they can be applied to elevating your career both financially and spiritually.

                        Gangaji teaches that much of our suffering comes from our searching and running from being humbled. To search you have to be some-body searching for some-thing. When you search you are always looking outside of yourself for the thing that will bring you peace. When you are “some-body” you fight bad experiences and struggle for good experiences. However when you experience a deeper surrender and allow yourself to become “no-body” then you allow the humbling and stop begging for what you think you lack.

There is no such thing as work and life, it is life and life.” Everything you do should be to enhance your own nature, because your inner situation will directly affect or hinder the external situation you want to create.  If you focus on harnessing your own inner energies, then you will find yourself and learn to create your internal situations to greatly enhance your external success.

Tolle focuses on “Three Modalities of Doing.” Acceptance, enjoyment and enthusiasm. To work consciously and sanely, you should be in at least one of these three modalities and if not, you will be in dysfunction and should remove yourself from that job or career and try to find your inner purpose.

Kabat-Zinn teaches that mindfulness is a love affair with life, and not just something you need to squeeze into your schedule. By cultivating moment-to-moment nonjudgmental awareness, you begin to embrace an awareness of the actuality of your experience and accept the good as well as the bad. Through the practice of meditation and mindfulness you can reveal a sense of deeper awareness, turning everything in one’s life into an adventure in living rather than just a chore or something that one has to do.
